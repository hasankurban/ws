DCEM is developed using R and is publically accessible on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at https://CRAN.R-project.org/. In particular we demonstrated that significant improvements in run time and number of iterations are achieved by embedding a heap structure within the framework of the traditional expectation maximisation algorithm Dempster et al. (1977). Our package makes use of the proposed data driven approach Kurban, Jenne, and Dalkilic (2016b) that, (1) avoids visiting all data and, (2) avoid continually re-visiting the data, to speed up the convergence process. We illustrated the practical utility of DCEM by performing several experiments across application domains that highlight the significant improvement in performance. In future, we would like to 1) extend this approach to use data structures that enforce total ordering for example, kd-tree. Min heap is a partially ordered structure and hence does not enforece a strict oredering on the data. We argue that by using a totally ordered structure, we can further improve the performance of iterative learning algorithms, 2) use this approach in contemporary iterative data mining algorithms i.e., k-means, an example of such work is also discussed in Kurban and Dalkilic (2017).\n","date":1587340800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587340800,"objectID":"26a124ac715da52c114744abe6bf3e9a","permalink":"https://www.hasankurban.com/project/package-project/","publishdate":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/package-project/","section":"project","summary":"Data Clustering with EM (DCEM) for Big Data, an R package","tags":["Unsupervised Learning","Clustering","Big Data","Expectation Maximization","Data Mining","Heap","R programming"],"title":"R Package","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mustafa Kurban","Hasan Kurban","Mehmet Dalkilic"],"categories":null,"content":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\n","date":1577664000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577664000,"objectID":"3742144273d046babcfc4713e97a2747","permalink":"https://www.hasankurban.com/publication/jm3/","publishdate":"2019-12-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jm3/","section":"publication","summary":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.","tags":null,"title":"Controlling structural and electronic properties of ZnO NPs: Density-functional tight-binding method","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hasan Kurban","Mustafa Kurban"],"categories":null,"content":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\n","date":1577664000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577664000,"objectID":"3442ff8dd2ead02909c47bbff50469c0","permalink":"https://www.hasankurban.com/publication/cm2/","publishdate":"2019-12-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cm2/","section":"publication","summary":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.","tags":null,"title":"Study of Structural and Optoelectronic Properties of Hexagonal ZnO Nanoparticles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hasan Kurban","Mustafa Kurban","Mehmet Dalkilic"],"categories":null,"content":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\n","date":1569456000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569456000,"objectID":"768a176ecf2232e17c7b51993a14edfa","permalink":"https://www.hasankurban.com/publication/jm1/","publishdate":"2019-09-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jm1/","section":"publication","summary":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.","tags":null,"title":"Density-functional tight-binding approach for the structural analysis and electronic structure of copper hydride metallic nanoparticles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hasan Kurban","Mustafa Kurban","Mehmet Dalkilic"],"categories":null,"content":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\n","date":1569456000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569456000,"objectID":"c5c254b37ba53d2c52471451e3895a00","permalink":"https://www.hasankurban.com/publication/jm2/","publishdate":"2019-09-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jm2/","section":"publication","summary":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.","tags":null,"title":"Size Dependent Electronic Structure and Structural Properties of Cupric Oxide (CuO) NanoParticles","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In order to conduct structural analysis, we also developed programs in R language to analyze the number of bonds, segregation phenomena, and RDF. We perform a theoretical investigation using the density functional tight binding (DFTB) approach for the structural analysis and electronic structure of copper hydride (CuH) metallic nanoparticles (NPs) of different size (from 204 to 2418 atoms). By increasing the size of CuH NPs, the number of bonds, segregation phenomena and radial distribution function (RDF) of binary Cu-Cu, Cu-H and H-H interactions are investigated using new algorithms. The results reveal that the number of bonds Cu-Cu is larger than that of Cu-H while H2 bonds are the smallest. Thus, the ability of Cu atoms to absorb large amounts of H is more than H2. The increase in the size of the NPs contributes to the stabilization because of the enhanced strength of H–H bonding. The segregation of Cu and H atoms show that Cu atoms tend to co-locate at the center, while H atoms tend to reside on the surface. From the density of state (DOS) analysis, CuH NPs shows a metallic character which is compatible with experimental data. HOMO and Fermi levels decrease from -3.555 to -3.443 eV and from -3.510 to -3.441 eV.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that theoretically shows convergence of iterative algorithms over heap structure–instead of over a cost function. This approach is tested over k-means (KM) and expectation-maximization algorithm (EM-T). The experimental results show dramatic improvements over KM and EM-T training run-time through different kinds of testing: scale, dimension, and separability. Regarding cluster error, the traditional algorithms’ and our extended algorithms’ performances are similar. For future work, clearly one obvious step is to add seeding to KM* drawing from both k-means++ and kd trees. Additionally,we are interested in the broader question of this approach to iterative converging algorithms. Further, are there better structures than heaps? Lastly, parallelization offers some new challenges, but also opportunities.\n","date":1512950400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512950400,"objectID":"36494a697a5e4b1dc1b8c837be23d263","permalink":"https://www.hasankurban.com/project/kmeans-project/","publishdate":"2017-12-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/kmeans-project/","section":"project","summary":"A Novel Approach to Optimization of Iterative Machine Learning Algorithms","tags":["Clustering","Big Data","Machine Learning","Data Mining","Heap"],"title":"Iterative Machine Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":["Hasan Kurban","Can Kockan","Mark Jenne","Mehmet Dalkilic"],"categories":null,"content":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\nClick the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature.\nSupplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1512432000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512432000,"objectID":"038f87fb5ff4efb82caaee794e228cdb","permalink":"https://www.hasankurban.com/publication/case-study1/","publishdate":"2017-12-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/case-study1/","section":"publication","summary":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\nClick the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature.","tags":null,"title":"Case Study: Clustering Big Stellar Data with EM","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hasan Kurban"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

While parallelism is an obvious and, usually, necessary strategy, we observe that both (1) continually revisiting data and (2) visiting all data are two of the most prominent problems especially for iterative, unsupervised algorithms like Expectation Maximization algorithm for clustering (EM-T). Our strategy is to embed EM-T into a non-linear hierarchical data structure (heap) that allows us to (1) separate data that needs to be revisited from data that does not and (2) narrow the iteration toward the data that is more difficult to cluster. We call this extended EM-T, EM*. We show our EM* algorithm outperform EM-T algorithm over large real world and synthetic data sets. We lastly conclude with some theoretic underpinnings that explain why EM* is successful.\n","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"500e82d680a443a9b60dd56f4024840f","permalink":"https://www.hasankurban.com/project/em-project/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/em-project/","section":"project","summary":"An Expectation Maximization Algorithm for Big Data","tags":["Clustering","Big Data","Expectation Maximization","Data Mining","Heap","Artificial Intelligence"],"title":"Clustering Big Data","type":"project"},{"authors":["Hasan Kurban","Mark Jenne","Mehmet Dalkilic"],"categories":null,"content":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\n","date":1499212800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1499212800,"objectID":"4c600dbc28c79d7d98512e28265b89ec","permalink":"https://www.hasankurban.com/publication/jdsaa/","publishdate":"2017-07-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jdsaa/","section":"publication","summary":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.","tags":null,"title":"Using data to build a better EM: EM* for big data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hasan Kurban","Mark Jenne","Mehmet Dalkilic"],"categories":null,"content":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\n","date":1476662400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1476662400,"objectID":"a2f35bc10fe142f6dcb98a4eab56a8f6","permalink":"https://www.hasankurban.com/publication/emdsaa/","publishdate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/emdsaa/","section":"publication","summary":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.","tags":null,"title":"Em*: An em algorithm for big data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark Jenne","Alex Zimmerman","Hasan Kurban","Claudia Johnson","Mehmet Dalkilic"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Indeed, the challenges are at least a century old. The problems are not with the data itself, but rather with the attention to the management of the “data ecology” in the information systems. Data needs to be accessible as an input to scientific inquiry—a requirement that goes far beyond simply centralizing the available data. Our research focuses on the development of a proofof-concept system that properly handles an information ecology. The power of such a strong foundation is then demonstrated in two ways: (1) through our data driven hypothesis generation system, built and employed for analysis of the relationship between coral disease and temperature in the Caribbean; (2) through programmatic search for patterns and anti-patterns that verify, falsify, or demonstrate no discernible relationship for a set of variants on a particular temperature–disease hypothesis.\n","date":1472688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472688000,"objectID":"c35816fcbfbc1b0ac69e0d4b272196a9","permalink":"https://www.hasankurban.com/project/climate-project/","publishdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/climate-project/","section":"project","summary":"EMPLOYING SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES TO  CLIMATOLOGICAL DATASETS","tags":["Data Science","Software Engineering","Computer Science","Reef Analysis"],"title":"Coral Reef Analysis","type":"project"},{"authors":["Hasan Kurban","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Red-RF also shows that the strength of a random forest can increase without noticeably increasing correlation between the trees. We then compare performance of Red-RF and Breiman’s RF in 8 experiments that involve classification problems with datasets of different sizes.
