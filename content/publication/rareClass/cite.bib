abstract = {This interdisciplinary study is conducted to find answers to two important questions which researchers often face in Machine Learning (ML) and Material Science (MS) fields . In this work, we measure the performance of the most popular ML algorithms (more than a dozen) on rare-class learning problem and determine the best learning algorithm for atom type prediction over the Mg-doped ZnO nanoparticles data obtained from the density-functional tight-binding method. As a result, we observe that tree-based ML algorithms such as Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF), outperform other types of ML algorithms, e.g., cost-sensitive learning, prototype models, support vector machines, kernel methods, on both rare-class learning and atom type prediction.}
