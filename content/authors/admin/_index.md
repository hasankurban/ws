My research and teaching interests include machine learning, data mining, big data, data science and artificial intelligence. I teoretically work on data-centric ML/AL and  also build machine learning systems over variaous domains such as material science, chemistry, bioinformatics, to help accelerating scientific discoveries. For example, we use ML to develop longstanding traditional quantum modeling techniques, particularly Density-functional theory (DFT), a computational method developed in 1970s, for modelling quantum mechanics that is among the most popular tools of the material scientists.
