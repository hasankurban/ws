Before joining the [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.qatar.tamu.edu/academics/ecen/) at [Texas A&M at Qatar](https://www.qatar.tamu.edu), Dr. Hasan Kurban was a Visiting Associate Professor in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.indiana.edu)  and [Data Science Program](https://datascience.indiana.edu/index.html) at  [Indiana University, Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu), where he received his Ph.D. in Computer Science with a minor in Statistics (2017) and where he is currently an Adjunct Professor.   Dr. Kurban works in AI both foundational and applied.  In foundations, he improves traditional model-centric algorithms by employing data-centric techniques resulting in vastly improved run times (while preserving accuracy) so that applications in big data are feasible.    In applications, he has improved public transport, clustered the Milky Way, and now is focusing on materials science--efficiently predicting properties of nanoparticles--and energy storage--efficiently predicting impedance for battery state of health and state of charge.   His most recent work,  ["Rapidly predicting Kohn-Sham total energy using data-centric AI"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18366-7), Kurban et al. in Nature Scientific Reports is among the first papers demonstrating how data-centric AI (DCAI) can be used to effectively improve materials science. Another recent work, ["State of charge and temperature-dependent impedance spectra regeneration of lithium-ion battery by duplex learning modeling"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352152X23004826) in Journal of Energy Storage shows how data-centric AI can effectively build an experimental space. 

**I am  actively seeking PhD students focusing on generative AI. Candidates with strong academic credentials, a keen interest in discovery, and a commitment to innovative research are highly desirable. If this aligns with your career aspirations, please forward your CV to hasan.kurban[at]tamu[dot]edu.**
