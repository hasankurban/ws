Pediatric diabetes I is an endemic and an especially difficult disease; indeed, at this point, there does not exist a cure, but only careful management that relies on anticipating hypoglycemia. The changing physiology of children producing unique blood glucose signatures, coupled with inconsistent activities, e.g., playing, eating, napping, makes ``forecasting" elusive.  While work has been done for adult diabetes I, this does not successfully translate for children.  In the work presented here, we adopt a reinforcement approach by leveraging the de Bruijn graph that has had success in detecting patterns in sequences of symbols--most notably, genomics and proteomics.  We translate a continuous signal of blood glucose levels into an alphabet that then can be used to build a de Bruijn, with some extensions, to determine blood glucose states. The graph allows us to ``tune" its efficacy by computationally ignoring edges that provide either no information or are not related to entering a hypoglycemic episode. We can then use paths in the graph to anticipate hypoglycemia in advance of about 30 minutes sufficient for a clinical setting and additionally find actionable rules that accurate and effective.
