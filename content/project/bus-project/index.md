Using a large volume of bus data in the form of GPS coordinates (over 100 million data points) and automated
passenger count data (over 1 million data points) we have developed (1) a system of analysis and prediction of future public transportation demand (2) a new model that uses concepts specific to college campuses that maximizes passenger satisfaction. Using these concepts we improve service of a model college public transportation service and more specifically the Indiana University Campus Bus Service (IUCBS).
